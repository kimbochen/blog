Hi, my name is Kimbo Chen, a MS CS student at University of California Riverside.

I have 2 academic goals:
- Making deep learning a robust and widely accessible technology.
- Accelerate the time and lower the cost of developing computer hardware.

I am active on **Twitter** ([@kimbochen](https://twitter.com/KimboChen)),
where I write about deep learning, computer architecture, and things I learned in general.  
You can also contact me using email: **chentenghung at gmail dot com**.


## Projects

### [Experimenting with JAX](https://github.com/kimbochen/jax-exp)

A non-trivial example of implementing a deep learning model using JAX.  
Link to Twitter threads: [Testing Phase](https://twitter.com/KimboChen/status/1447407465897742338)
| [Full Project](https://twitter.com/KimboChen/status/1472514513077686272).

- It contains a minimal neural network library implemented from scratch using JAX.
- A small GPT model is implemented using the library, including the training and evaluating code.


### [PanoDPT](https://github.com/kimbochen/panodpt)

An implementation of the paper **Dense Prediction Transformer**.

- Refactored the original implementation and organized the project using PyTorch Lightning.
- Designed a 2D scatter operation using Torch Scatter to process panoramic images.


### [Systolic Array in PyRTL](https://github.com/kimbochen/play_pyrtl/blob/master/systolic-array.ipynb)

Explained how a systolic array works using the register-transfer level design library PyRTL.  
[Link to Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/KimboChen/status/1488041353015889920)

- Implemented a 2 by 2 systolic array using PyRTL.
- Walked through cycle by cycle how the systolic array computes a 2 by 2 matrix multiplication.


### [ALREC: Army Leave Report Chatbot](https://github.com/kimbochen/army-leave-reporter)

A chatbot I wrote when serving in the military to deal with the incoveniences of reporting status.  
[Link to Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/KimboChen/status/1485091997106905093)

- Deployed a LINE chatbot on hosting service Heroku using Google Sheets as backend.
- Streamlined the reporting process of a 15-person message group.


## Research Interest

I am interested in machine learning systems, MLOps, and computer architecture in general.  
Here are some papers I read and summarized:
- [Divide and Conquer: Leveraging Intermediate Feature Representations for Quantized Training of Neural Networks](https://twitter.com/KimboChen/status/1473322134428844034)
- [VOS: Learning What You Don't Know by Virtual Outlier Synthesis](https://twitter.com/KimboChen/status/1492749206674567168)
- [Planaria: Dynamic Architecture Fission for Spatial
Multi-Tenant Acceleration of Deep Neural Networks](https://twitter.com/KimboChen/status/1480080025659785218)
- [Dark Silicon and the End of Multi-core Scaling](https://twitter.com/KimboChen/status/1477551532870893575)

I also covered many parts of the Tesla AI Day:
- [Vision](https://kimbochen.github.io/posts/tesla-ai-day-vision/)
- [Auto Labeling](https://twitter.com/KimboChen/status/1497868229359800321)
- [Tesla Dojo Computer](https://twitter.com/KimboChen/status/1449721898682646533)


## Community Experiences

I attended many online events to meet other researchers and learn new things.  
After attending, I wrote down what I learned.
Here are some highlights:
